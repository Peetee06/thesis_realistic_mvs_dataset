\chapter*{Abstract}
With autonomous driving being very popular and gaining a lot of publicity these days there is lots of money and research going into the topic of Artificial Neural Networks that decide how to drive these autonomous vehicles. Currently Deep Neural Networks are the go to architecture used for this task. These Networks need large amounts of data to learn how to properly classify objects in the driving environment so the system can make the right decisions. Currently the best results in training are achieved through supervised training, i.e. having the expected output (ground truth) for each given input. Creating datasets for autonomous driving applications that contain real world images and accurate ground truth is time intensive and therefore very costly. In contrast there are many approaches that can cheaply generate loads of synthetic images from virtual worlds with accurate pixel-level labeling. Models that are trained on these synthetic datasets perform worse in the real world due to the domain shift (changes in texture, lighting,...) between the synthetic and real domain. The research area of Domain Adaptation tries to adapt these two domains so that the difference between them is reduced in order to make it possible to train Deep Neural Networks on cheap synthetic images and still able to perform well in the real world. There are many approaches to Domain Adaptation while one is currently standing out and getting a lot of focus by the research community: Generative Adversarial Nets \cite{NIPS2014_5423}. This work shows three alterations of this network architecture, namely CycleGAN \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/ZhuPIE17}, CyCADA \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1711-03213} and SG-GAN \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1801-01726} and compares them on the synthetic-to-real domain shift using GTA5 \cite{Richter_2016_ECCV} and Cityscapes datasets \cite{Cordts_2016_CVPR}.


\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
I want to thank everyone that helped me create this work. Especially Anastasia Bitter for her emotional and active support, Stephan Richter for explaining some aspects of the GTA dataset to me and Taesung Park for sending me a pretrained CycleGAN model. Further I want to thank my mentors Despoina Paschalidou and Yiyi Liao for their guidance and support and Professor Andreas Geiger for enabling me to work on this topic and the help in defining it precisely.
