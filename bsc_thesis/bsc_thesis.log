Class scrbook Warning: You've used obsolete option `cleardoubleempty'.
(scrbook)              Usage of this option indicates an old document
(scrbook)              and changes compatibility level using
(scrbook)              `cleardoublepage=empty,version=first,
(scrbook)              enabledeprecatedfontcommands' that may result
(scrbook)              in further warnings.
(scrbook)              If you don't want this, you should simply
(scrbook)              replace option `cleardoubleempty' by `cleardoublepage=em
pty'.

Class scrbook Warning: deprecated option `enabledeprecatedfontcommands'.
(scrbook)              Note, that this option was already depreacted when
(scrbook)              it has been defined. Support for old font commands
(scrbook)              has been removed from KOMA-Script more than one
(scrbook)              decade ago. It is not recommended to use them any
(scrbook)              longer. Therefore usage of this class option also
(scrbook)              is not recommended.

Class scrbook Warning: Usage of package `fancyhdr' together
(scrbook)              with a KOMA-Script class is not recommended.
(scrbook)              I'd suggest to use 
(scrbook)              package `scrlayer' or `scrlayer-scrpage', because
(scrbook)              they support KOMA-Script classes.
(scrbook)              With `fancyhdr' several features of class `scrbook'
(scrbook)              like options `headsepline', `footsepline' or command
(scrbook)              `\MakeMarkcase' and the commands `\setkomafont' and
(scrbook)              `\addtokomafont' for the page style elements need
(scrbook)              explicite user intervention to work.
(scrbook)              Nevertheless, using requested
(scrbook)              package `fancyhdr' on input line 35.

Class scrbook Warning: \float@addtolists detected!
(scrbook)              Implementation of \float@addtolist became
(scrbook)              deprecated in KOMA-Script v3.01 2008/11/14 and

(scrbook)              Since Version 3.12 support for deprecated
