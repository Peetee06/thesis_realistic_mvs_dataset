\chapter{Comparison}
\label{sec:comparison}

In this chapter the three Domain Adaptation Techniques \textit{Cycle Consistent Adversarial Domain Adaptation}, \textit{Cycle-consistent Generative Adversarial Network} and \todo{add 3rd technique} will be compared by analysing similarities and differences. Furthermore pretrained models of each architecture were tested and the results will be compared on \todo{add benchmark(s)}.

\section{training the nets on tcml cluster} \todo{is this necessary or can we just use provided pre-trained models?}

\section{comparison Benchmark(s)}
